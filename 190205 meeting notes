Notes from 2/5/19 project team meeting:

Plans for future WCPSS papers:

1.	Choice/compliance (Thad and Jay are leading)
2.	2nd Generation segregation – what do the classroom assignments/school placements/peers look like for reassigned students in their new schools? Do schools segregate internally when reassignment makes their enrollments more diverse? (Thad and Jay will lead)
3.	Effects of reassignment:
a.	Achievement (Andrew will start working on identification strategy)
b.	Discipline (Andrew and Rachel will lead)
c.	Longer term – HS grad, college enrollment, labor market (Matt will lead)
4.	School effects vs. neighborhood effects (Deven will lead)
5.	Civic effects
a.	Reassignment effects on parent voting (did reassignment mobilize white parents in particular?) Alternatively, node voting effects on reassignment (did WCPSS avoid reassigning kids in highly engaged neighborhoods?)
b.	Reassignment effects on kid voting/party affiliation (could hypothesize via peer effects literature.)
6.	Teacher race match (Andrew wants to lead) 

Timeline/goals:
	-Preliminary report in to WCPSS in Feb
-WCPSS advisory board meeting in May? (Are people available for a project meeting in this period? It would be good to have preliminary descriptive data on reassigned kid educ outcomes ready for this meeting.) 
-Choice compliance paper drafted spring semester
-Teacher data online by summer to allow working on 2nd Gen segregation and teacher issues
